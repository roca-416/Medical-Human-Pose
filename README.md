# Medical-Human-Pose
Dataset for paper "LIDAR-based 3D human pose estimation and action recognition for medical scenes"

### Summary
The Medical-Human-Pose dataset contains 3752 depth images of people standing, sitting, lying, and falling in medical scenarios (laboratory simulations). For each image, the location of 15 human body parts are labeled with 3-dimensional (x,y,z) coordinates relative to the sensor position, the 4 vertex positions of the human target surround box are labeled as two-dimensional (x,y) coordinates.

### Structure
- Depth maps
- Keypoints
- Bounding Boxes

### Declaration
This dataset only contains the data collected by our team themselves in the laboratory of Beijing Institute of Technology, and the data collected in the hospital is not publicly available due to privacy and permission issues.
